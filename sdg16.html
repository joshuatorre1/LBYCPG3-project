            Without peace, stability, human rights and effective governance, based on the rule of law - we cannot hope for sustainable development. Some regions enjoy sustained levels of peace, security and prosperity, while others fall into seemingly endless cycles of conflict and violence. High levels of armed violence and insecurity have a destructive impact on a country’s development, affecting economic growth and often resulting in long standing grievances that can last for generations. Sexual violence, crime, exploitation and torture are also prevalent where there is conflict or no rule of law, and countries must take measures to protect those who are most at risk.The SDGs aim to significantly reduce all forms of violence, and work with governments and communities to find lasting solutions to conflict and insecurity.

            The SLGP of the DILG seeks to equally assist all muncipalities in having access to basic facilities through needs-based approach by strengthening the Local Development Councils (LDCs) in becoming more capable partners in national development and strengthening of LGU abilities to deliver basic services. It shall provide a revitalized thrust to government’s efforts to contribute to the realization of a responsive national priorities and budget. Through the LDCs, LGUs engage civil scoeity organizations and people’s organizations in the selection and monitoring of projects in their muncipality. This supports Goal 16 by promoting responsive, inclusive, participatory, and representative decision-making at all levels.

            <p class="card-text">Enabled by Executive Order No. 2, s. 2016, the <strong>FOI Program of the Presidential Communications Operations Office (PCOO) is the government’s response to the call for transparency and full public disclosure of information.</strong> Through FOI, citizens are empowered to make a formal request to get information held by the government, barring certain sensitive and important data related to the nation’s security. FOI complements continuing proactive information disclosure efforts where agencies are duty-bound to publish information in the spirit of openness and transparency. The implemention of the FOI program will ensure public access to information, a key SDG indicator under this Goal. It will also contribute partly to ensure responsive, inclusive, participatory and representative decision-making at all levels. This enables citizens to participate in the democratic process through readiliy available and accessible government data.</p>
