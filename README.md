Print media, broadcast media, and support media are some of the key ways to disseminate information regarding the various Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). However, these types of media have their own limitations such as cost and limited audience. With this, the proponents aim to develop a local website for disseminating the United Nations (UN) Agenda for SDGs. This website will be developed through the help of various concepts such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap. From here, the website was able to successfully provide information on what the purpose of each SDG is. At the same time, it provides information on the various SDG projects done in the Philippines.
