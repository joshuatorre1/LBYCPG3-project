							<h5 class="card-title">FREE TVET PROGRAMS</h5>
							<p class="card-text">Free <strong>skills training, assessments and other benefits, as applicable under TESDA scholarship programs,</strong> namely:
							(1) Training for Work Scholarship Program (TWSP). The TWSP seeks to support rapid, inclusive and sustained economic growth through course offerings in priority industries and key employment generators such as agrifishery/agri-business/agro-industrial, tourism, information technology-business process management (lT-BPM), semi-conductor and electronics, automotive, other priority manufacturing industries, logistics, general infrastructure, and new and emerging sectors. The program is addressing poverty reduction through TVET for Global Competitiveness and WET for Job Readiness; and (2) Private Education Student Financial Assistance (PESFA). This program was established through Section 8 of Republic Act No. 8545, otherwise known as the Expanded Government Assistance to Students and Teachers in Private Education (GASTPE) Act. PESFA offers educational grants to qualified and deserving college freshmen both in degree and nondegree courses. The program seeks to: extend financial assistance to marginalized but deserving students in postsecondary nondegree courses; promote TVET; contribute to the development of a competent skilled workforce; and assist private institutions in their development efforts by assuring a steady supply of enrollees to their course offerings. The PESFA directed the beneficiaries on the choices of careers to the critical skills requirements of indemand jobs in the labor market. It also allows for equity distribution of the opportunities made available through government subsidies.

							<h5 class="card-title">ALTERNATIVE DELIVERY MODES</h5>
							<p class="card-text">Two of the major ADMs of DepEd include <strong>the Modified In-School, Off-School Approach (MISOSA) and the Enhanced Instructional Management by Parents, Community, and Teachers (e-IMPACT) MISOSA.</strong> MISOSA involves subdividing congested classes (with more than 50 students) in Grades 4, 5, and 6 into an in-School Group with classroom and subject teachers and an Off-School Group with para- or volunteer teachers. E-IMPACT on the other hand is a technology-enhanced ADM that addresses issues in accessibility and quality of education in schools handled by a few teachers teaching multigrade classes, and allows learners who are otherwise prone to prolonged or seasonal absences to enter and exit when needed, learning from modules with the support of fellow learners, family members, and the community, and their progress/advancement measured via mastery tests taken in the school.

							<h5 class="card-title">UNIVERSAL ACCESS TO QUALITY TERTIARY EDUCATION</h5>
							<p class="card-text">The <strong>Universal Access to Quality Tertiary Education Act (RA 10931) </strong>which was signed into law last August 2017, is a Philippine law that institutionalizes free tuition and exemption from other fees in state universities and colleges (SUCs), and local universities and colleges (LUCs) in the Philippines. The law also foresees subsidies for private higher education institutions. It is intended to give underprivileged Filipino students a better chance to earn a college degree.</p>
